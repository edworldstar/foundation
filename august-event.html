				<h1>OUR MISSION</h1>
<p><span class="top-txt">The Worldstar Foundation is a nonprofit organization compassionately dedicated to improving the lives of the American people and the less fortunate around the globe. Our mission is to bring inner city youth educational tools for success as well as strengthening inner city communities around the world. The Worldstar Foundation was established with the core objective to perform charitable services to ENHANCE productivity and quality of life for the needy. The immense problems plaguing the country's citizens are widely pervasive and the Worldstar Foundation aims to broaden it’s embrace to provide effective health care, educational resources, and various other vital services.</span></p>
				
				<p><span class="top-txt">The Worldstar Foundation is proud to be based upon progress, success, and perseverance, these are the values it aims to instill upon all those it aspires to serve. America’s tomorrow looks bleak when the children who will be running the country in the future are not given the education and the tools needed to succeed, which is where we want to help most of all by offering educational materials and support to those in need. It is not just here in our home of the United States that sees children suffering from the lack of support, and as the Worldstar Foundation grows we hope to broaden our embrace to provide as much support possible to those in need.</span></p>
				
				<p><span class="top-txt">To the Worldstar Foundation, each and every individual is recognized as a person, not as another statistic in an issue. The organization is driven by passion and compassion for the wellbeing of all people, regardless of color, age or background. The Worldstar Foundation is based on the simple principle of logic, and is driven by rigor, results, and finding the most detrimental issues to assess and overcome. The foundation’s innovations translate into both exploring and creating new opportunities for not only the individuals we aim to aid, but also for individuals who strive to help his or her fellow man.</span></p>
				
				<p><span class="top-txt">The Worldstar Foundation’s strategies help define its path to success, but overall sustainability is based largely in the aggregate power of its initiatives to influence holistic change. The organization’s focus on economic empowerment unlocks numerous possibilities on both the individual and communal levels. Work in the field of global health saves lives by addressing the critical needs of families and communities, helping them truly thrive not only today, but in the future too. The Worldstar Foundation’s efforts on education help ensure that individuals are equipped with the right tools to achieve a life of true fulfillment and gratification.</span></p>
